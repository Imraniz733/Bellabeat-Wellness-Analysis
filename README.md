## Data Description 
Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data
Source: Kaggle (CC0: Public Domain)[link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)

This dataset, provided by Mobius on Kaggle, includes detailed personal fitness tracker data from thirty Fitbit users who consented to share their data for analysis. The dataset records minute-level output on physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring, along with daily summaries of activity and step counts. These insights allow for an in-depth exploration of users’ habits and wellness patterns.

Data integrity verification is essential to ensure the analysis is based on accurate and reliable information. By confirming the quality of this dataset, we can derive trustworthy insights that effectively address our research questions and inform actionable recommendations.

## Data Cleaning And Processing
#### Upon reviewing the files, I found that the "dailyactivity" dataset contains all the necessary data for a comprehensive analysis. This dataset includes information such as total steps, activity levels ranging from sedentary to active, calories burned, and total distance covered. These metrics provide valuable insights into high-level trends and daily activity patterns of users.
We began with two files containing daily activity data, each structured identically. After merging them, we conducted data cleaning by checking for null values and duplicate entries and standardizing date formats for consistency. With these steps completed, the data is now cleaned, organized, and ready for analysis.
